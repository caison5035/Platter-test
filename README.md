Read the below instructions carefully:

Create the design above with at least 10 Product Cards. On mobile only the first 4 should show, and the “Show More” Button should trigger a smooth dropdown revealing the other 6 products.

Hover over the Image should swap the Image to a secondary Image.  Please use Free Stock images as placeholders: https://unsplash.com/
Using the following tech stack:

- `HTML`
- `JavaScript`
- `TailwindCSS`

The main objective of this tech challenge is to see your ability to create designs using `TailwindCSS` and well structured semantic `HTML`.

The design needs to be fully responsive (desktop/mobile). Please use plain JS (VanillaJS) for any functionality. The scrollbar thumb should increase to 6px height when hovering / touching it, this will require hiding the default browser scrollbar. 

The Show More button (mobile only) should trigger a dropdown revealing the other product cards.


Bonus task: Migrate the design into a Shopify Section, using liquid and a schema input on a development store. (This can be mocked up without the dev store)  
Objective: The aim is to see your thinking & process along with creating the designs. Please create a Git Repository for the work and add as many Commits as you think will help showcase your development process.  Once Completed: Please send through a link to the completed Git repository. The preview should be as simple as opening the main HTML file, or alternatively host the example online for preview. There should be no local build step required to review the final result.
